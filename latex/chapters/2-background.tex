\chapter{Background Information}
\label{ch:background}

A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if
your work spans two or more traditional fields. That means that your readers may
not have any experience with some of the material needed to follow your thesis,
so you need to give it to them. A different title than that given above is
usually better; e.g., "A Brief Review of Frammis Algebra."
