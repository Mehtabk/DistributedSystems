\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

Solving a problem is one thing, evaluating how good the solution is, is another
thing. In this chapter you evaluate your solution analyzing it using various
scientific methods, e.g., experiments, interviews, etc.

Here you should include

\begin{tight_enumerate}
    \item The results are actual statements of observations, including statistics, tables and graphs.
    \item Indicate information on range of variation.
    \item Mention negative results as well as positive. Do not interpret results --- save that for the discussion.
    \item Lay out the case as for a jury. Present sufficient details so that others can draw their own inferences and construct their own explanations.
    \item Break up your results into logical segments by using subheads
\end{tight_enumerate}
