\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:discussion}

While in chapter \ref{ch:evaluation} you just report the results of the
evaluation, here you discuss what the implications of the entire work are. It is
like making a step back and rethinking what you did and how it contributed to
the research questions you posed yourself.

This section should be introduced by a few sentences that summarize the most
important results. The rest of this section should answer the following
questions:

\begin{tight_enumerate}
  \item What are the major patterns in the observations?
  \item What are the relationships, trends and generalizations among the results?
  \item What are the exceptions to these patterns or generalizations?
  \item What are the likely mechanisms underlying these patterns?
  \item Is there agreement or disagreement with previous work?
  \item What is the relationship of the present results to the original question?
  \item What are the things we now know or understand that we did not know or understand before the present work?
  \item What is the significance of the present results: why should the reader care?
\end{tight_enumerate}
