There are two options:
1) You use something like https://www.sharelatex.com or https://www.overleaf.com/ and work only online or
2) You install Latex and the necessary tools locally on your computer 

If you choose 1), do not forget to regularly backup your work, otherwise terrible things can happen (e.g., to delete all your work the day before the deadline)

If you choose 2), here is the recommended set of tools to install:
- https://git-scm.com 
- (optional) Some GUI client, like TortoiseGIT or GithubDesktop
- Install the compiler:
  - On PC
    - https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads
    - https://miktex.org/download
  - On Mac
    - brew install perl
    - brew tap miktex/miktex
    - brew install miktex
    - mpm --admin --verbose --package-level=basic --upgrade
    - initexmf --admin --mklinks
- Install a previewer:
  - On PC
    - https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html
  - On Mac
    - http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/
    - Run in terminal: 
      - defaults write -app Skim SKAutoReloadFileUpdate -boolean true 
   - Open the Skim app, open Settings, switch to Sync and activate to check for modifications
- https://code.visualstudio.com/ (to have a nice editor)
